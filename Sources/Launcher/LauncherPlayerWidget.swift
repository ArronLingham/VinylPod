/// The now-playing card for Anchor's Option+Space launcher.
///
/// **Not reachable inside VinylPod**, which has no launcher. It is built now,
/// against the same engine as everything else, so that wiring it up at Anchor
/// integration is a matter of placing this view in `LauncherWidgetStrip` rather
/// than writing a fifth player.
///
/// It replaces `LauncherVinylWidget`, which draws a static 38pt circle that does
/// not spin and carries no transport. Anchor's reason for that is recorded and
/// was good: the launcher dismisses on tap, so a button you press vanishes
/// before it does anything. VinylPod's card **opens the desktop player** instead
/// of dismissing, which is what makes transport worth having.
