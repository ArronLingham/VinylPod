/// Undo for the layout editor.
///
/// Every edit was destructive and the only way back was Reset, which throws away
/// the whole surface. That is a bad trade for a mis-drop: you lose ten minutes
/// of arranging because one element went in the wrong cell.
///
/// Deliberately **not** `UndoManager`. That is tied to a responder chain and to
/// window focus, and the editor lives in a `TabView` inside a window that an
/// accessory app raises by hand — the chain is exactly the thing that already
/// swallowed `showSettingsWindow:`. A plain stack has no such dependency and
/// its behaviour is obvious.
///
/// History is per surface, because the surfaces are independent everywhere else
/// and an undo that jumped you to a different tab would be alarming.
