#
# Two things this gets right that a naive `ps %cpu` loop does not:
#
#   * `ps -o %cpu` reports CPU time over the process's WHOLE LIFETIME, not
#     current load. For a long-lived menu-bar app it converges on a number that
#     says nothing about now. This samples cputime and divides by elapsed wall
#     time between ticks, which is actual instantaneous CPU.
#
#   * It aborts if the pid changes mid-run. Two measurements in this project
#     were silently garbage because the app was rebuilt and relaunched under the
#     sampler, and the numbers were quoted for weeks before anyone noticed.
#
# RSS is `ps` RSS, which is what every figure in CLAUDE.md's table was taken
# with. Do not swap it for top's MEM column — that counts shared and
# compressed pages differently and is not comparable to those rows.
#
# Let the app settle 12+ MINUTES before believing any RSS figure. Anchor
# recorded 82.5 MB from a process that actually settled at 18.5 MB, and the
# samples looked perfectly flat the whole time (82.5 mean against an 83.6 max).
# Watched on one process: 96 -> 80 -> 45 -> 24 -> 19 MB over about twelve
# minutes. Five minutes is not enough, whatever the variance says.
#
# Check the sample count in the output before quoting anything. Two figures in
# Anchor's history came from runs of 7 and 15 samples; a window that short
# cannot see the tail, and reads exactly like a quiet app.
